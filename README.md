## Question 1: Expand Characters in a String
Given a string containing characters followed by digits expand each
character by repeating it according to the digit that follows.


## Example:





## 

-  Input: "a1b4c3"
-  Output: "abbbbccc"
## Explanation:
- The character 'a' is followed by 1, so it appears once.
- The character 'b' is followed by 4, so it appears four times: "bbbb".
- The character 'c' is followed by 3, so it appears three times: "ccc".
- The final output is "abbbbccc".



## Constraints:
- The string will only contain lowercase letters followed by digits.
- The input string length will be at most 100.

## Question 2: Character Frequency in a String

Write a Java program that takes a string input and outputs the frequency of
each character in a compressed form.

## Example:

- Input: "aabcccdeee"
- Output: "a2b1c3d1e3"

## Explanation:

- The character 'a' appears 2 times.
- The character 'b' appears 1 time.
- The character 'c' appears 3 times.
- The character 'd' appears 1 time.
- The character 'e' appears 3 times.
- Concatenating these frequencies results in "a2b1c3d1e3".

## Constraints:

- The input string will only contain lowercase English letters.
- The input string length will be at most 1000.

## Question 3: Prime Number Checker

Write a Java program to determine if a given integer is a prime number.

## Example:

- Input: 21
- Output: "The given number is NOT prime"

## Explanation:

- The number 21 is divisible by 3 and 7, hence it is not a prime number.

## Constraints:

- The input will be a positive integer between 1 and 10^6.

## Question 4: Number to Words Converter

Write a Java program that converts a given integer into its written English form.

## Example:

- Input: 51
- Output: "fifty one"

## Explanation: 

- The number 51 is represented as "fifty" for 50 and "one" for 1.

## Constraints:

- The input will be a positive integer between 1 and 1000.

## Question 5:  Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Example:

- Input: s = "abcabcbb"
- Output: 3

## Explanation:

- The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

## Constraints: 

- 0 <= s.length <= 50,000
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.
